# 1D Motion Profile Path Generator
Generates a 1 dimensional path for the robot to follow based on motion profiling

This project is designed to work in conjunction with performance logging on the robot to capture acceleration and deceleration statistics as well as a motion profiling execution utility which follows the generated path using an augmented PID loop.

This project is a work in progress. It has yet to be tested with CSV data and may not function.
